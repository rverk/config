Shell Settings
==============

This is my config setting I use for bash and vim.

90% is a blatant copy of the excellent `the Ultimate Bashrc File <http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Ultimate+Bashrc+File?content=129746>`_

The remaining 10% are the settings I've gathered over time making me more efficient.
